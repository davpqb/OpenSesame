# Hi, my name is Davis Rodriguez 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at UMBC and a full-stack developer with interest for educational technology. By the end of my career, it is my mission to have helped bridge the gaps between education and accessibility.

This repository serves as my creative project submission for the OpenSesame Internship. Instead of a video or a slide deck, I wanted to do this in the way I'm most comfortable with: code and documentation.

# 1.) How do you see OpenSesame fitting into your career journey or long-term goals?

My last role was at *For Students by Students*, where I helped build a Learning Management System (LMS). I worked on the referral workflows and backend APIs that connected users to content on our webpage. That experience sparked a long-term goal for me: I want to build tech that makes education both accessible and affordable. 
OpenSesame works perfectly with that goal because you guys are doing exactly what I want to do. I want to learn how to take the concepts I worked on—like user interactions and agile development, and apply them to a larger platform.

# 2.) What strengths, skills, or perspectives will you bring to OpenSesame to make an impact and contribute to our mission?

I have experience working with Java SpringBoot, GraphQL, and Vue.js. Through my time with the CyberDawgs Club, I’ve learned to build with security in mind (using tools like Wireshark and Nmap, which is critical for enterprise software. 
I'm bilingual, and I’ve worked as an Aquatics Facility Manager—leading a team of 30 total employees. I know how to handle pressure, stay punctual, and communicate clearly when things get chaotic. I work well on deadlines because I know how to organize a team to meet them, and how to navigate them myself.

# 3.) What excites you most about working with AI, and how do you think it can shape the future of learning and work?

What excites me most about AI is it's potential to act as a bridge to those with less opportunity. High-quality tutoring and advising have always been expensive luxuries. If you didn't have the money—you didn't get the mentorship. AI destroys that barrier. It allows us to build co-pilots, or personalized tutors for learning that are accessible to anyone, anywhere, for a **fraction** of the cost.

I believe AI will shape the future of work by removing the "I don't know how" mantra, enabling everyone to be more efficient. Rather than waiting for a skilled professional to train you or answer questions—we may soon have alternatives at our fingertips. I want to help build that future.
